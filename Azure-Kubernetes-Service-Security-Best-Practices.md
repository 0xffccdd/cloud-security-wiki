As more and more businesses move their applications to the cloud, the need for reliable cloud-based container orchestration grows. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed Kubernetes service that makes it easy to deploy and manage Kubernetes applications.

You can get a playbook on how to respond to security incidents in Cloud and Container environments [here](https://offers.cadosecurity.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-forensics-of-mining-malware-in-linux-container-and-cloud-environments).

AKS features include:
- Automated upgrades and patching of Kubernetes
- Easy deployment and scaling of Kubernetes clusters
- Integrated monitoring and logging
- Integrated security with Azure Active Directory and role-based access control (RBAC)

AKS is highly available and can scale to meet the needs of your applications. AKS also integrates with Azure Monitor and Azure Log Analytics to provide insights and analytics into the health and performance of your Kubernetes applications.

To secure your AKS deployment, you should take the following measures:
1. Use role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to Kubernetes resources.
2. Use Kubernetes security features, such as Pod Security Policies and Network Policies, to restrict access to specific pods and networks.
3. Use the Azure Kubernetes Service security features, such as TLS and Pod Security Policies, to restrict traffic between pods and services.
4. Use the Azure Kubernetes Service Update Management feature to ensure that your Kubernetes nodes are up-to-date with the latest security patches.
5. Use the Azure Kubernetes Service logging and monitoring features to track and troubleshoot security issues.
6. Use the Azure Security Center to monitor the security of your AKS deployment.
7. Use pod security policies to restrict the resources that pods can access.
8. Enable HTTPS for secure communication between your AKS cluster and clients.
