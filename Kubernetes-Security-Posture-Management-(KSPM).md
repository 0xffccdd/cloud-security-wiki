Kubernetes Security Posture Management (KSPM) is a critical part of ensuring that your Kubernetes environment is safe and secure. By using KSPM, you can continuously assess the security of your Kubernetes environment and take action to improve its security posture.

You can get a playbook on how to respond to security incidents in Cloud and Container environments [here](https://offers.cadosecurity.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-forensics-of-mining-malware-in-linux-container-and-cloud-environments).

Kubernetes Security Posture Management (KSPM) consists of the following key components:
1. Continuous Monitoring — Continuous monitoring is essential for detecting and responding to threats in your Kubernetes environment. By using a combination of agents and scanners, you can detect changes in the security posture of your Kubernetes nodes and clusters.
2. Security Automation — Security automation helps you to quickly and easily respond to threats in your Kubernetes environment. By using scripts and tools, you can automate the process of securing your Kubernetes nodes and clusters.
3. Security Orchestration — Security orchestration helps you to quickly and easily respond to threats in your Kubernetes environment. By using a combination of scripts and tools, you can automate the process of securing your Kubernetes nodes and clusters.
4. Security Dashboard — The security dashboard provides a consolidated view of the security posture of your Kubernetes environment. By using the security dashboard, you can quickly identify threats and take action to improve the security of your Kubernetes environment.
5. Security Reports — Security reports provide detailed information about the security posture of your Kubernetes environment. By using security reports, you can quickly identify threats and take action to improve the security of your Kubernetes environment.
