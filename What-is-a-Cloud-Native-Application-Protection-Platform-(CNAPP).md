Cloud Native Application Protection Platform is a term used to describe a platform that provides security and governance for cloud-native applications. Cloud-native applications are software applications that are designed to run on a cloud computing platform, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure.

Cloud-native applications are different from traditional applications in a number of ways. For example, they are often composed of microservices, which are small, self-contained applications that can be deployed and managed independently. They are also often deployed using containers, which are lightweight virtual machines that can run on a variety of different operating systems.

One of the challenges of managing cloud-native applications is ensuring that they are secure and compliant with corporate policies. Cloud-native Application Protection Platforms are designed to address this challenge by providing security and governance features specifically for cloud-native applications.

Some of the features that are typically included in a Cloud Native Application Protection Platform are:
- Security scanning: The platform can scan cloud-native applications for vulnerabilities and provide recommendations for fixing them.
- Identity and access management: The platform can manage the identities and permissions of users who are accessing the applications.
- Data governance: The platform can help to ensure that data within the applications is properly secured and compliant with corporate policies.
- Reporting and analytics: The platform can provide detailed reports on the security and compliance status of the applications.

Cloud-native Application Protection Platforms can be a valuable tool for organizations that are migrating to the cloud. They can help to ensure that applications are secure and compliant with corporate policies, and they can provide valuable insights into the security and compliance status of the applications.
